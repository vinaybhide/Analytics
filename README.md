            <h4>Reson behind developing Portfolio Analytics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>While researching on multiple website's to manage my investment portfolio as well as do market research, 
            I realized that none of them offer following features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Consolidated portfolio valuation graph that can be compared against market indices</li>
                        <li>Transaction based portfolio management</li>
                        <li>Country agnostic stock portfolio- I wanted to have a portfolio that can include stocks from US as well as Indian stock market</li>
                        <li>Allow SIP transactions for mutual fund to be maintained in exactly the same way the fund house is executing the transaction</li>
                        <li>Define & adjust parameters for strategy graphs to help customize different technical indicators</li>
                        <li>Show each graph on separate window so as to easily compare them</li>
                        <li>Importing existing portfolio</li>
                        <li>Useability was a big issue as well, as most of the existing applications lack simplicity of use.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Why develop new financial market data access API?</h4>
            I researched through various open source libraries to access market data and understood their advantages, benefits as well we limitations. 
            I concluded that none of them are really free & provide the data that is useful & real-time. 
            That drove me to a conclusion that in order to build a application to facilitate research of market data and maintain portfolio, 
            I will need to first build a suite of API that will fetch real-time market data for both stock as well as mutual funds. 
            <ul>
                <li>API that provides real-time as well as historical stock & mutual fund data
                <ul>
                    <li>Search a stock symbol belonging to any global stock market</li>
                    <li>Get quotes for any stock symbol belonging to any global stock market</li>
                    <li>Get current as well as historical daily & intra-day pricing data- open, high, low, close, volume</li>
                    <li>Get current and historical market index data for over 30+ market indices</li>
                    <li>Get tech indicator data based on current as well as historical market data</li>
                    <li>Search mutual funds available from specific fund house</li>
                    <li>Get latest as well as historical NAV data</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
